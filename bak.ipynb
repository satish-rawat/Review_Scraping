But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone?

Infinity O Display/Punch hole Display2. Hardware(Screen Sound Technology, On Board features)3. Triple CamerasThanks to this Galaxy M40 should be the most affordable smartphone to feature a Punch hole Display and I Love it. The punch on is on the left here. But, it still gives the M40 a very S10e while and It sure looks good. Now so like the subtle transitions on the punch or when you use face lock or when you open up the selfie cap. Now it\\'s really cool and this means the Galaxy M40 looks great from the front. So, thanks to the punch hole this is a good looking smartphone now.What would have made better things even better is an AMOLED display like the other Galaxy M series. But, sadly that wasn\\'t to be this. Here is a Bezel-Less 6.3\" FHD+ 2340X1080P PLS TFT LCD display with 91.8% usable Screen to body Ratio and protection of Corning Gorilla Glass V3. Immersive 19.5:9 screen ratio seems pretty good and looks wider in viewing video files. The display has vibrant colours and it\\'s pretty bright. Overall a very pleasing display not ambulant but definitely decent. I also like the brightness of the display. So even If you know you\\'re someone who uses your phone outdoors a lot in bright sunlight. You really wouldn\\'t have lot of problems reading in bright sunlight.The next highlight of the Galaxy M40 is it\\'s Hardware.Samsung Galaxy M40 comes with the Snapdragon 675 processor and Adreno 612 GPU with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of Internal storage and it expandable upto 512GB. I\\'m using 400GB Micro SD card for saving my Personal files like Photos, Videos, Musics, Movies, Backups etc... Phone works perfectly after installing 400GB SD Card.Now the specs sound awesome for a Samsung mid-range right for a long time. Samsung\\'s budget and Mid-range smartphones have been marred by underpart processors and the Galaxy M40 with the Snapdragon 675.Samsung Galaxy M40 has been smooth and nice for me in day to day tasks which is great. But I know you\\'re wondering about gaming on the Galaxy M40. Adreno 612 GPU enhance the performance while gaming. The PUBG Mobile runs on high graphic settings default and game plays fairly smooth and nice. It\\'s a good news for all PUBG lovers. Snapdragon 675 the performance definitely seems positive on Galaxy M40.This phone did not have traditional ear piece. So, the call quality is important for this device. This device comes with a Screen Sound Technology which the Screen vibrates the audio range to produce sound. While calling, You can place your ear in anywhere of the screen and You can here the voice. The call sound quality is good.The last highlight is the Triple Camera setup. It\\'s not the same triple camera setup as the previous Galaxy M30. These ones are in upgraded. There\\'s a 32 megapixel F/1.7 Aperture Primary camera and 8 megapixel F/2.2 123° ultra wide angle camera and 5 megapixel F/2.2 Live focus camera. Samsung also includes a Flash in rear . M40 can record 4k videos at 30fps and Super Slow-mo videos at 240fps. It also have super slow-mo and hyper lapse video recording options . Video is very stable and its quality is decent. Front camera its the usual 16 megapixel F/2.0 Aperture camera. Selfies and photos captured in rear cameras are good right the sharp and well detailed.Overall I like the fact of the Galaxy M40 comes with ultra wide angle lens. But apart from that I\\'ve really sure on the primary camera of the Galaxy M40. Because, I\\'ve always liked the Cameras on Samsung\\'s phones and M40 is decent too due to the details and consistency is kind of surprise. Hopefully Samsung did a great job.Apart from that you get the usual buttons, the fingerprint scanner on the back, the USB C port. There is one thing missing. The head phone jack is gone now. This is rather bad news for budget smartphone buyers. But at least Samsung bundles USB C earphones with the phone. Anyway on the softly from the Galaxy M40 comes with OneUI on top of Android 9 Pie onboard which makes it the first smartphone in the M series to come with OneUI. This is the proper OneUI with the OneUI features, The features I\\'m talking about is the one-handed usage friendly UI which is something I really like very cool dark mode of navigation gestures and more plus the phone comes with the Android 9 features like detail well being. The Galaxy M40 seems pretty sorted on the software front now all that is good. This phone comes with Dolby Atmos mode that can be enabled only after you\\'ve plugged in your earphones. You\\'ll really feel the difference in the sound quality.The fingerprint sensor, Which I really prefer over any in display fingerprint sensors for ease of use. But, which are slow and unpredictable. The Galaxy M40 has the fastest fingerprint sensor and It placed pretty appropriately as well. It have a face unlock as well which works equally well and I would prefer this even over the fingerprint sensor. In terms of building design the device is a very good size and it fits very well in hand, Not too heavy and feels really well balanced. At the back camera unit does elevate a little, But that doesn\\'t seen like much of problem. It\\'s all plastic which keeps the weight light. However it doesn\\'t feel cheap or poor quality despite the low price point.Moving on to the batteries, The Galaxy M40 comes with a 3500mAh battery which does sound a bit modest and Samsung bundled a 15w fast charging adaptor on it. This charger charges the phone from 10% to 50% in around 30 minutes.Apart from that the phone has a hybrid sim slot. So you can either use dual sims or a sim card with a micro sd card well. This phone supports 512 GB additional Micro SD Card support. And the both Sim Slots supports Jio VoLTE.An another feature I like in this phone was, Every time you unlock you present it with a lock screen that contains a story. Now these lock screen stories change each time you lock and unlock your display. You can get more information about that particular lock screen story and you could flip or you could slide to access more of these. There\\'s actually a setting inside lock screen. Where you could go to lock screen stories setting and you can choose categories from where you do want this feed or you can turn it off completely.Finally I would still go ahead and say that it does offer excellent value for money. So, If you want to stretch your budget and you\\'re looking for a phone from one of the best smartphone makers around the world the Galaxy M40 is probably your answer for that. So, thats it from me. Hope you\\'re enjoyed the review. If you\\'ve got any questions you can leave them in comment section below and I\\'m going to answer them to my best capacity.Thank you', 'A great phone with a brand in a decent price', 'Product was awesome..Thank you Amazon', 'Display quality is wonderful.

Good package overall.', 'READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS—1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons—1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT—If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala', \"The only reason why I'm giving a rating of 4 to this handset is, it has a c-type pin for headset and the extension cables for normal headphone Jack to c-type doesn't work in this handset when they're connected!\", 'Camera quality good but not best', 'Value for money phone.', 'All looked fine but I finally found speaker is problem.Speaker has some big zz noise.I will check whether repair is possible at Samsung service.If not I have to replace or return...', 'The camera quality is awesome front camera with latest technology is mind blowing some thing new and also the screen speaker its something new and  dislike is battery must be above 4000 to 4500', \"Got this phone today.

So, I'm gonna write everything about the product in this review.*For those who don't know about the M series, It is an attempt by the Korean brand to capture the budget smartphone segment, which is dominated by Xiaomi in India. Let's see if they are successful in it.Design & Display-*The M40 has a premium body design with a glossy dual tone effect, which is one of the highlights of the device.*Comes in 2 beautiful colors, though I wish there were more.*It features an Infinity O or Punch hole display, a segment first, which was seen only on a flagship like the S10 amounting more than 50k.*It stands out from the crowd as it looks really cool and futuristic.*The screen to body ratio is 91%.*The Full Hd resolution is a treat to your eyes.*It has Corning Gorilla Glass.*It's incredibly light when compared to all metal body phones out there.*It has a hybrid card slot and dual 4G sim slots.*Another coolest thing about the phone is the On-Screen Sound Technology, which transforms the whole screen into a speaker and thereby increasing the screen to body ratio.Performance-*It comes with the Snapdragon 675 processor, the latest 6 series processor from Qualcomm.*The phone is capable of handling multitasking as well as day-to-day tasks.*The battery will easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage.*On a daily basis, I watched videos, played games, using social media, messaging apps, making calls as well as listened to music online.*Gaming is really good. Thanks to the Adreno 612 GPU.*PUBG on the phone is really amazing and fast. The default setting is HD graphics and high frame rate which works flawlessly.*The storage is expandable up to 512GB.Camera-*M40 features a 32MP triple camera rear shooter with a focal length of F1.7 which is really cool.*F1.7 helps in getting good low light photographs.*It features an 8MP Ultra-Wide Lens for a 123-degree field of view to capture exactly what your eye can view.*Dedicated 5MP depth sensor for amazing portrait shots.*A 16MP front camera to get those crisp and beautiful selfies.*It has slow-motion, super slow motion, hyper-lapse, 4K video recording, and many more features.*It has an AI-based scene optimizer.*I'm impressed by the camera quality of this 20K price range phone. (Check the sample Images uploaded)*The photos clicked with the rear camera are crisp, detailed and color reproduction is impressive. In bright outdoors, depth of field effect on both the front and rear cameras can produce some great results.*I’m waiting to add google camera and see the results.Operating System-*It's coming with OneUI with Android Version 9 Pie.*I personally like the look and feel of the OS which is simple and smooth.*I guess the phone will be getting one or two major Android updates in the future.Battery-*It comes with a 3500mAH lithium-ion battery.*It supports Fast charging.*Comes with 15W Type C Fast charger.Other Points-*Fingerprint Scanner and Face Unlock works flawlessly.*Comes with Type C earphones in the box and the quality of the earphones are really good.*It gives great entertainment benefits with Widevine L1 and Dolby Atmos.*Comes with all necessary sensors like Accelerometer, Fingerprint Sensor, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Hall Sensor, Proximity Sensor, Virtual Light Sensing, etc.Overall Verdict-*The M40 features a first in segment infinity display, unique design, good performance, good battery life, a hybrid card slot, and a competitive price which makes it the best smartphone in the 20K range.*The value for money pricing can give a tight competition to Xiaomi and other phones in this price range.*If you've any queries regarding the product or its working, feel free to contact me. Happy to help.*Hope this was Helpful.Happy Shopping :)\", \"Heating, battery drain vary fast, not locking good, Camara quality very bad don't buy this mobile.

Love these minute details! ፨ Comes with the first in segment infinity o display, which is a head turner in just 20k!! ፨ The punch hole screen has a 91% screen to body ratio, with very narrow bezels with a little chin but less than iphone xs ፨ Plus a Widevine L1 certification is good to see, which allows for watching Full HD content on Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. ፨ Sound on display and NFC as this price point is great. ፨ SAR Value 0.200 W/Kg at least Samsung cares for our health👉 CAMERA🔸32MP Triple Rear Camera ፨ You\\'ll get a 3 camera combination all i experienced is it performs well in well-lit-situations ፨ Portrait shots came out really well defined and the background blurred ፨ Don\\'t expect much in dimly lit situations as the pictures lacked details and were not quite sharp.🔸Front Camera ፨ The 16MPshooter does a good job in daylight. i especially liked the ones with beauty features turned off. ፨ The pictures look sharp enough with details & colors seemed close to natural, which i liked. However ,i noticed that some photos looked burnt out. ፨ The Low-Light performance was a bit of a miss as the camera ends up losing details in photos & smoothing the edges,which makes it look artificial.👉 PERFORMANCE ፨ Samsung Galaxy M40 is powered by the same Snapdragon 675 processor, same as rival Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro. ፨ Frankly, day-to-day performance is not an issue on the phone as it can handle most daily tasks such as making calls, messaging, browsing social media, listening to songs, etc with ease. ፨ PUBG can be played on high settings ፨ I did not notice lag or stutters while switching between tabs, even with multiple tabs open. The apps opened quickly. ፨ There is no 3.5 mm headset jack, which could be an issue for some users but now i\\'ve shifted to bluetooth devices but still i would love the option. ፨ By the way thanks to samsung for Type-c Earphones In box👉 GAMING 🎮 I played graphics-heavy games like Asphalt 9 without a stutter for up to 30 minutes. There were no noticeable frame drops & heating issues which is great. The phone does get a little warm from the top within 15-20 minutes when playing such games. 🎮 Also i played PUBG on high settings and the game had a sooth experience.👉BATTERY 🔋 The 3,500mAh battery lasts for a day with moderate usage, which includes making calls, streaming music, watching videos for about two hours daily, and browsing social media. 🔋 The battery is smaller than 5,000mAh on Samsung’s own Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M30 as well as Galaxy A50 in the same price bracket, which is a bit disappointing. 🔋 A full charge from about 20 per cent battery left takes a little over an hour(1hr 36min) (comes with a 15W Type-C Fast Charger in the box, as compared to Redmi Note 7 Pro, where u need to buy a fast charger separately).👉 VERDICT⚡ Samsung Galaxy M40 appears to be a decent phone for the price. really a OMG deal with Infinity O display!!⚡ Yes, there are multiple options in the market like the Redmi Note 7 Pro and Moto G7, but still I genuinely liked the Galaxy M40.⚡ It gets a lot of things right, and that’s what matters to average users at the end of the day.⚡ If you are looking to buy a mid-range smartphone that offers a large display for watching videos, has a respectable camera and looks stylish, I Think you should probably consider the Galaxy M40.⚡ I\\'ve to say it’s kind a Best smartphone under 20000 which has premium features under budget.🔴If you have any Doubt regarding this Review or this Product, then Feel Free to Contact me or Just ask me by commenting below.

Loved It...', 'So I\\'ve had this phone for about 5 days now, but I think that should be enough for me to review it.This is my first phone ever and so I was carefull in researching which one I should buy, and I settled for the Galaxy M40 (midnight blue).Screen Quality:Aside from the quality of the black colours I could not find any difference between the Amoled panel of the Galaxy M30. The colours look vibrant and lively and the brightness levels too are very good. No problem in viewing it in broad daylight. The difference in Black too is noticeable only when you have something to compare it with and you look at it in dark environment. So I have absolutely no complaints there. The Hole Punch display makes it look highly desirable too.Camera: The Camera modes are exceptionally diverse and you\\'ll find every setting you could wish for. Hyperlapse, Slo Mo, Super Slo Mo, everything. The wide angle lens is the most useful feature of this setup for me. The colours look realistic if not poppy (which you can alter in the settings). Also you have to manually set the camera to it\\'s highest resolution in the settings.  The details could have been better for a 32 MP Sensor, but they are very good nonetheless.Hardware: The hardware is arguably the best you could find under the 20000 INR range. The only phone that compares is POCO F1. The SD 675 Is highly competent at handling pretty much anything you throw at it and the RAM management is good too. It can play PUBG at (High, HD, Shadows enabled) with ease. The phone is light and a little slippery due to it\\'s \"Glasstik\" back. The back looks very premium. Better buy a protective case with this.Battery: Now this is something about the phone that might be a dealbreaker. The battery fast charges to full in an Hour and 30 mins and is enough for regular use (Social Media, an hour of moderate gaming) even upto a day and probably more. But that\\'s it. If you plan on doing intensive tasks without a plug nearby, you could be in trouble. The absence of a headphone jack adds to the problem with you not being able to charge while listening to music. So tread carefully.Overall,I\\'d easily recommend this phone to anyone in the market for the 20K segment. I could not have made a better choice (as of now). The phone ticks each box except for battery capacity. It\\'s a Samsung( with a brand value that Xiaomi, Poco, Vivo and oppo cannot match) so I highly doubt you\\'ll have any post purchase issues.Thank you, for reading the review.', 'Samsung galaxy M40 supplied by  Amazon on 20 6.19.

Expecting updates to further enhance.👍 \\xa0Has all Indian Bands covered with dual VoLTE.OTHER FEATURES===============🆗\\xa0No 3.5 mm headphone jack }-- Only type C earphones can be used or need to use Type-C to 3.5mm adapter but most phones in future will move to Type C earphones👍 Type C earphones provided along with the phone }-- thanks for the earphones👍 \\xa0On Screen Sound }-- The entire display is the speaker, so while taking call I was able to hear the other person by placing my ear on any part of the display. No worries about earpiece grill and dust. Keep ear on the screen. First time it might take some time to adjust, but soon you might start liking this as you don't need to keep the ear at a specific place.👍 \\xa0Support Dolby Atmos }-- Very good quality sound from bottom firing speakers, and screen doubles as a speaker too.👍 \\xa0Rear Finger print reader }-- placed in a good position reachable by the finger and is fast.🆗 No infrared remote, not a deal breaker for me.👍 \\xa0Bluetooth version 5.0 with A2DP, LE.🆗 Dual tone colored but 2 color options only  }-- I wish there was a red, white and black variant.👍 The phone is just 7.9mm and weighs 168grams. It easy to hold and grip.OVERALL - WORTHY BUY========\\xa0 :::::::::::::::::::::>> When considering this price segment, the Samsung M40 seems to be the best all rounder.>> Hoping that the the software updates can make the capable camera hardware to do best job and also enhance battery, though am satisfied with the current performance. You can check the pictures i took with the M40 on a gloomy day where sunlight was less.👌🏼 The latest 675 processor, On Screen Sound technology, Dolby Atmos sound, Type C with earphones in the box, triple camera setup, super slow motion, 6GB RAM for multitasking, 128GB on board storage with expandable storage and within Rs.20000 makes this the best budget All-Rounder phone from Samsung.👉 Amazon giving the phone as exclusive and with offers from all major carriers makes is a good move.👌🏼  PUBG and Asphalt runs smooth with HD and High settings makes me happy with the buy. Good to have Snapdragon in the M series.Overall a great budget phone within 20k, the Infinity O Display looks so cool and it looks like a S10e. Though the current display looks very good especially with punch hole notch, I wish the display was AMOLED. And also wish there was a red or white variant and maybe a metallic finish. The phone has touched all areas with a good score.\", 'Good quality..', 'Good camera quality and battery life also good.', \"Bought this mobile with some great expectations from Samsung and let’s see if it met them or not.Contents:🔹Handset🔹Quick charger🔹USB type C cable🔹Type C in ear earphones🔹Sim ejection tool🔹User manualInitial impressions:📌 The product is way better than other models and that's mainly due to the shiny poly carbonate back which attracts fingerprints but unexpectedly not slippery at all and gives a great option for one handed usage.📌 The lack of more Colour options rather than just blue might be an issue for some people but i love this colour.📌The mobile is light in weight and very thin as well improving its looks.Comes with Oreo out of the box with Samsung's latest one UI.📌Good to see so many customisation options.Skipping all the usual stuff here are some important information about the deviceDisplay🔹I was skeptical about the quality of the display quality especially due to the absence of sAmoled display but the difference isn't much as the display is sufficiently brighter and the viewing angles are great.🔹Overall the experience was good with the infinity O display and the very small bezels.Camera▪The triple camera setup seems to work well especially in day light conditions.▪The primary shooter produces some really good images.▪Its already great to have a wide-angle camera.▪There is a dedicated camera for the depth effect which produces clear cut background effect for portrait photography.▪Super slow motion is finally available in M series and its a feast a watch it.▪It is capable of recording the videos at 4k which was missing in earlier models.▪Front camera performance is also good and no serious issues observed.▪Pro mode for experienced shootersPerformance🔹Packing with Snapdragon 675 SoC performance isn't a problem at all with this mobile.🔹The RAM management is great and the apps will never load out of memory with day to day usage and even with some intense gaming.🔹The experience is very smooth and no lagging is observed.Battery🔸the battery lasts really long even with the 3500 mAh battery as the SD 675 SOC is power efficient.🔸the charger bundled is quick charging capable and charges the mobile in around 90-100 minutes.Gaming performance🔹I played Pubg and asphalt with all the settings put into high and the experience was good.🔹There is no lag observed while playing and even after switching between games.🔹the default settings came as high for Pubg and it ran very smoothly.🔹There is no heating issue observed except a slight warm at the back even after some intense gaming.Pros🔺📌Good design📌Camera performance📌Processor📌Screen sound technology📌Support for wide vine L1📌Good performance in terms of gaming📌NFC capability📌Dolby Atmos📌DDR 4 Ram (faster)Cons🔻📌Missing of the headphone jack...well this might be an issue for some people but hopefully they did it better by providing the type c earphones out of the box and being a user of all wireless audio systems, it won’t bother me though as it actually helps in making the mobile thin📌Camera bump as more chances to get damaged in case of damages.🔸Other than these two I didn't find any issues so far and since the two are not a deal breakers I can say that I had no issues with the mobile so far.🔹and finally with usage of around a week I can definitely feel it as one of the best mobiles sub 20000 categories as of now.🔹Will be updating the review if required.I hope am helpful 👍\", 'Overall very good product for use.', 'Excellent Product in reasonable rate', 'Premium productSome improvements should be done in calling sounds and camera by updates', 'The phone is good with all features in it including battery life the camera and also has good network', 'I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,Display and camera are great.

It was decent too when I was using it out of the box, but after installing the day one update, the battery performance has become horrible.

The 170k+ antutu scores that YouTubers were recieving were a sham, or maybe these \"reviewers\" were given some special units which were beating Redmi Note 7 Pro in antutu. This phone is supposed to have Snapdragon 675, and this is the performance I get? My Moto G5S plus performs better than this phone.

Its battery maybe compared with my iPhone 7!!!', \"I bought the Samsung Galaxy M40 after careful deliberation and research. I wanted the latest cutting edge features and best configuration possible in my restricted budget of 20K. Below are my detailed observations regarding the features that make the Samsung M40 stand head and shoulders above any similar phone in the same price bracket. Many of these features were earlier only available on flagship phones at twice the cost and I feel Samsung has aggressively and effectively shattered the glass ceiling on budget phones with the premium feature packed M40. I will also try to provide detailed insight and my practical first hand experience with the M40's features while using it. I hope it helps you in getting a comprehensive in-depth understanding of the features.Looks, Feel and Functionality:● Infinity-O Display : M40 is the first Smart phone in this price range to feature the Infinity-O display which was only available in the flagship S10 series till now. This feature enables an expanded screen size with a screen-to-body ratio greater than 91% with FHD+ resolution by minimising the bezel even further, thereby providing a larger screen size without actually increasing the size of the phone. In fact the M40 has the thinnest bezel in the Galaxy M range. The uninterrupted mesmerising edge-to-edge experience actually makes the display look bigger than the phone you're holding in your hand.● Punch hole front camera : The infinity-O display provides the solution to create a cut-out in the upper corner in which the Selfie camera is discreetly tucked away, accurately placed while maximising screen real estate and maintaining the larger screen-to-body ration with the minuscule almost-bezel-less display. This is not distracting at all unlike the previous in-your face notch in the center and I felt it is really a great unobtrusive placement which lets you forget it's there till you use the front-cam. Again this punch hole design was previously featured on the S10 series and till now was a flagship phone feature.● Qualcomm 6xx series 2Ghz Octa-Core Snapdragon 675 with Adreno 612 GPU : This is the first M series phone featuring this latest 6xx Qualcomm 675 Snapdragon processor which has previously only been used in flagship phones. Simply put this processor super-powers the M40 for smooth, reliable and steady performance. It makes the M40 blistering fast with negligible app load times and allows brisk multi-tasking with numerous app loaded without any lag or delays. I felt the entire usage experience breezy, swift and snappy. The Adreno 612 GPU in combination with the processor handles the most graphics-intensive games comfortable without any slowdown or jitters that I could notice in games like Pubg and Asphalt 9 with its default setting of HD and High frame rate.● Triple Rear Camera Setup: The Samsung M40 comes with the best and latest in class combination on its cameras. The triple camera combination is more advanced than the M30 with its 32 MP primary lens which clicks pictures in really great clarity and detail and its f/1.7 aperture offers flexibility to get good shots in low light. It also features a 5 MP depth sensor with f/2.2 aperture for amazing portrait snaps and I've takes some of the most vivid pictures of my daughters with the M40 already. It also features an 8 MP ultra wide-angle lens with f/2.2 with 123 degree field of view for excellent reproduction while capturing landscape shots. The front camera is a huge 16 mp Selfie and video calling camera with vibrant results and the above combination is a first for the Samsung M series. The camera also features Slow Motion, Ultra Slow Motion, Hyper Lapse and video recording at the industry latest 4K quality. The M40 also features an AI based scene optimiser which gives outstanding results and sublimely attractive photographs. Focus locks quite fast and daylight shots are crisp and vibrant with colours quite close to real life optics.● Wide vine L1 and Dolby Atmos : One of the most under rated but beneficial feature in this time and age of online streaming is the strangely unknown Wide vine L1 certification that the Samsung M40 has. It is one of the rare phones which is certified and will stream popular streaming videos from Netflix, Amazon Prime and Google play in true HD quality. Most phones do not feature or advertise this and simply provide non-hd content even on their HD or 4K supported phones. Definite plus for me as I spend a lot of time streaming movies and binging on show and find the true-HD experience awesome. Dolby Atmos brings cinema quality surround sound and was previously engineered on Flagship phones and increases the audio/visual experience even for gaming.● On Screen sound technology : The M40 introduces the ground breaking futuristic On-Screen sound technology in the M40. The speaker is placed below the display effectively turning the entire display into a virtual speaker. This provides the benefit of saving speaker space thereby increasing the screen size and reducing the bezel further. The phone still needs to be placed in the normal position on the ear for best results and calling is crisp and clear in my experience when done so. This also translates into no speaker slot and grill to get clogged or damaged owing to daily use which is a nifty advantage for me.● Android Pie and OneUi : This is the first Samsung Device which features latest version Android Pie pre-installed ready to use right out of the box. The M40 runs on the OneUI which is Samsung's custom software based on the android 9.0 Pie update. The user interface comes loaded with a minimalistic design which is optimised for a smooth and simple user experience with tons of customisations that can be done. There is a system wide Night Mode, support for dual messenger and some nifty gesture based navigation controls and the UI really makes one-handed usage easier. Pre-installed apps can be uninstalled but most are useful.More Highlights, Features and Functionalities :● The Samsung M40 has a 6.3 inches FHD+ capacitive touchscreen with Corning Gorilla Glass protection.● At 7.9mm thickness combined with 168 gms weight in hand it is really lightweight and ergonomically designed.● Featuring 6 GB ram with 128 GB storage capacity expandable to 512 GB it takes care of all your speed and storage requirements.● Features Dual Hybrid sim slots for flexibility. Allows you to use 2 sim cards simultaneously or to expand storage using SD Card.●  Has 3500mah optimised Lithium-ion battery which easily give you a day's backup with around 20% left at the end of the day if you have heavy usage like me or a day and a half's backup if you have moderate usage.● Good anti-glare visibility under sunlight owing to its 480 Nits brightness.● Incorporates facial recognition for unlocking along with fingerprint scanner built into the back which is snappy and fast.● Other sensors available on the M40 include Accelerometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Hall Sensor, Proximity Sensor and Virtual Light Sensing.● The M40 Comes with a 15W fast charger which takes around 1.5 hours to charge phone to full.● The M40 does away with the 3.5mm headphone slot and provides the future ready slimmer Type C earphones in box. The provided high quality earphones have crystal clear and crisp output and provide good immersive music experience.● The M40 has had a bundled launch with loads of network offers which you can benefit from, including savings of 3110/- on Jio Galaxy Club with its double data offer, or get 100% more data upto 840 GB for 10 months on Airtel or Vodafone Cashback worth 3750/- on 50 recharge vouchers of 75/- each along with 250 GB data with additional 0.5 data for upto 18 months.● The Company provides 1 year manufacturer warranty for phone and 6 months warranty for accessories in box from date of purchase.Downsides:● Samsung could have tried to squeeze in a bigger battery and it could have been a phone lasting 2 days.● There should be more colour options even in metallic finishes or a size variant.● Really need more options for protective accessories.● Samsung could have worked on IPS certification and made the phone waterproof.The Samsung M40 is a beautifully crafted mobile which looks both premium and elegant. The dark Blue hue with a gradient finish across the back of the panel blending into a seemingly lighter blue colour on the curved edges gives it a dual tone effect, making it look strikingly smart and sleek. The deadly combination of stunning looks with it's innovative and latest advancements and novelty features make the M40 quite a pleasure to own and use and in my opinion makes it one of the best budget smartphones under 20k.\", 'Very nice product with a superb colour and also very nice camera features I loved the super slow mo feature the battery life is a bit low but overall this product is Fantastic', 'Worst product ever from Samsung the sound quality is really very bad and phone gets heated up and if I ask for a replacement From the amazon app it asked me to install an other 3rd party app from my phone please checkout the pick which I have posted Samsung has manufactured as 6gb ram but in that application it shows like it has 8gb ram please don’t fool us kindly please refund the money', \"I bought Samsung M40 in 19990 ..it's price is too high as compare to phone.
