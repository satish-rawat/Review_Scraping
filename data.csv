"I bought this phone on the first day of the sale,rear camera is below decent. Don't know if I got the defective piece.
"
"Display and camera are great. Phone looks good. Only supports type C headphones which might be a problem for few
"
"Good
"
"Worst camera and ear piece is really horrible.. There is no Samsung pay also.. Honestly the worst phone to buy
"
"Lookwise and Operation wise superb phone.. Operates smoothly with sanpdragon.. Display is awesome specially with lighting around front camera... holding in hand gives super premium feeling.. I didn't like the camera quality at all.. bokeh effect pathetic even in full day light... low light photgraphy at night not upto the mark... Except camera outstanding phone...After 7 days of use... Notification a big problem. You can't even turn off.. I get some useless notification 3-4 times in a day and there is no option to turn off.. Can Samsung Justify why you don't give option to turn off???
"
"Plz avoid buying ....1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly...
"
"Looks stunning... Performance is good.. One UI is awesome. But need to improve the in screen sound technology..
"
"Excellent. I like this phone. Only the one thing is the audio Jack is missing it may be revolution for the type-c cable. Super slow motion  camera is super and fingerprint  response is so fast as light.

"Worst experience battery drains fast...many applications not supported ...voice clearty very bad....
"
"Initial Review - Phone look very nice, lightweight, finger sensors are very fast to recognise, phone is working very smooth and fast. Charging is good too.Cons  - Picture quality is not upto the mark from Camera, it's not crisp looks smudged which is Trend in most Android phones I think, but good enough, Wide angle works nicely.  - It works on Indian Sim only, which is a big drawback for me, may be not for others.Will update more review while I use the phone.

"Camera is not upto the mark, work ok with g cam but g cam work very slow ,,,rest display and feel of the phone is nice ,,processor also works fine
"
"Camera Quality is really bad , feels like a device from 2019 has a camera quality of 2015.The Device started to heat in just 30 minutes of Video call on Whatsapp. And Hell lot of Bugs .
"
"Got this phone today. Every thing about this phone is good except On-Screen sound technology.The voice clarity is not being reproduced well and even in slightly noisy environment its difficult to converse without asking the person on other side to repeat a few times.Battery doesn't last even a day
"
"Please dont buy it.The main issue is battery. Its heating after taking 2-3 pics, also draining very fast.  I have seen it first day and want to change with other model, but they didn't help with that. So please choose other option. Its not worthy to money.
"
"Camera quality very worst.Battery backup average onlyDisplay not as expectedLow sound

"Mobile gets too hot while playing pubg. Front camera is not good. Pubg not works properly in balanced graphics. Don't  buy this if you play pubg waste of money
"
"Not having Samsung Secure Folder is the only disappointing part!!
"
"Problem with in-call speaker. Makes buzzing sound when volume is full while receiving a call or making a call.
"
"Pros :Camera is good .Both selfie and rear cam.Cons :Fast charging doesn't help.Fast charging takes more time .doesn't look like fast charging.Too much of heating issues.For this spec, atleat 4500 mah battery would be required.Yet to install games like clash royals n pubgHope to have further updates

"Having switched from Iphone 6 to Samasung M40 was a pleasure and smooth experience. I don't feel I am missing my Iphone any more.PROS:1. Screen is really huge and very bright.2. Viewing angles are good.3. The feel of the polycarbonate body is really great. Feels like a premium phone.4. Having NFC is a gread deal.5. Samasung has done a great job with OneUI. Its fluid smooth.6. Performace wise this phone is one of tge top having Snapdragon 675. Doesn't heat up at all with average usage.7. The phone is light weight and form factor is also good.8. Both front and rear camera take good shots, offers a bunch of features like wide angle shot, slowmo, hyperlapse etc.9. Pubg, NFS, Asphalt games running like butter. Didn' observe any lag till now.CONS:1. Till  now I have felt only the battery backup is the concern. Feel like if battery was of 4000mah this would have been great. Though I guess this phone can last 1.5 days with average usage after full charge.CONCLUSION:I bet anyone will be amazed by the design and feel of the phone at this price. Really a great deal. Cameras do a great job. Dolby atmos really packs power to your entertainment. ONEUI experience is fluid and one can fall in love with way its designed.
"
"Sound quality while calling is so totally bad.and if ur coming to camera it is not meeting the spec as per mentioned in product description.when iam checked Samsung opera centre bangalore they have informed me this series are coming like this .They said they are helpless on this issue. iam going to replace this product asap.pictures will not a good quality I think seller given me duplicate product
"
"SIM tray not opening, without SIM it is everything but a phone.So called ""On screen"" speaker is pathetic. Sound quality used to be much better in earlier mobiles.Camera is average. You might say that for this price don't expect more than this. But then why triple camera. Even single camera would have given if not better then same results.
"
"20k waste one of the worst mobile. They gave lots of adds for this mobile. After bought samsung cheated with fake features. Not worth for 20k. My money lnly wasted. If i seen this mobile in showroom i never bought this only.
"
"Very...........Bad quality.Not fast charging,poor battery performance.,camera not just like SamsungNot support Samsung apps.over all worst phone
"
"Front camera not good , on call speaker very bad quality, always this mobile very bad experience
"
"M40 Mobile is awesome. I have usee iphone 6 and 7 and moto g5s plus. As compare to those phone M40 is better in look and quality. Plastic uses for phone is good and its dual Volte means we can use two JIO sims at same time. 32MP camera is decent. Selfie camera is also good. Battery also perform good. Screen of phone should be little wide needes. I ordered and got seawater color whoc is a different color and looks ao nice. Its sceen is working as earpiece speaker means they have not given and mesh for listening its screen is working like ear speaker. You can listen the voice of other person from screen from holding phone from middle or below. Whole screen is working like speaker.
"
"The design is good and sleek and the phone feels light too but I really miss the 3.5 mm audio Jack. The in box earphones sound good but feel quite cheap.The fingerprint sensor being a conventional one is fast and can also be used to swipe down/up the notification panel.The UI is quite good and smooth and also includes the dark/night mode which I really love. I increased the animation speed to 0.5x from developer settings which I usually use.The rear triple camera setup is just okay. You can get 32mp only in one mode and in that too pictures are not very clear. Although the front camera is quite good and can take pictures in portrait mode too. Before this, I was using MIA1 and I feel the rear camera of my 2 year old phone was better than this one. I just hope that the camera improved with future updates as the hardware is very capable and just needs a bit of software tweaks. I've seen in YouTube videos that you can install gcam directly which gives better photos .The battery is just okay and would harely last a day with moderate usage. It give a screen on time of around 4 hrs.For gamers, don't expect very high performance. For smooth running of PUBG, You will have to reduce the graphic settings. I didn't play any other game.The phone does not have an earpiece and instead uses some kind of screen vibration technology to produce sound.The display is just okay and you will face difficulty reading in open. The punch hole camera looks great and gives a premium look to the phone.You can get it for 19k using the bank offers.If you want a very premium looking smartphone with very good UI and a trustworthy brand but can compromise on battery and display(M30 gets a sAMOLED display at a lower price) go for it.Overall 7/10
"
"Pros : 1. Good display  2. Light weight  3. Punchole front design is good  4. Internal memory is goodCons 1. Speaker not so effective  2. Front camera not that much clear  3. No notification led or any other mode given.
"
"Built quality, Camera result and performance is good as expected, it offers an Infinity-O display that is unique to this segment, a Snapdragon 675 chipset and a 32MP triple camera setup. But it also lacks an AMOLED display and a headphone jack. Overall worth for Money...
"
"This device is awesome got it today . Very fast delivery from Amazon.Awesome displayBattery is averageHeadphone output like JBL headphones it's awesome with DolbyCamera performance is excellentIt runs pubg like butter  ultra settingsI like this device by Samsung and it's one ui just fall in love with it .

"
"I have purchased this product in the first sale but the mobile is Not a good one camera performance is average and it's too sleepri. The screen sound technology is not so good. I have purchased the product after watching so many review from youtube but they may be paid reviews. Disappointed with the phone.
"
"Phone is awesome but the ear phone that came with the device is not working.  When asked for replacement they are giving option to replace the complete device. Which is unfair as it took 5 hrs for setting up device and installing apps
"

"
"Positive :feels best to hand , compact, design, display, batteryNegative: half of the ram is being used without installing any apps ,system occupied 26gb storage,front camera shows dots,camera shloud be more better on this price range.
"
"It is a very good looking phone.  But the only problem is the battery and we have to purchase the type c to 3.5 MM jack adapter  .the camera is good with super slow and slow motion mode and in front camera there is a wide mode too . And I think it is a very good phone . I think it is better than a50 because it gets in display finger print which is extremely slow and irritating.
"
"Don't buy this product your money is waste if u buy this product not working properly and ear voulme is not coming
"
"It is a great phone if we compare it with old Samsung phones these are much better both quality, specs and price.Pros1. Good build quality2. Infinity O display is just amazing.3. Great design4. Triple camera setup with main 32 mp camera.5. front camera is good.6. One ui with android pie.7. Fast charging support 15w8. Type-c earphones are included.9. Snapdragon 675 soc10. 6gb ram & 128gb internal storage.11. Has NFC support as well.Cons1. No 3.5 mm audio jack2. Tft display which is not that good at outdoor3. No case or protective film pre applied4. Rear camera is clear but when we zoom pic little bit there is no detailing. Samsung should work on its camera and puch ota soon.5. Battery is small only 3500 mah which is very less from its predecessors which have 5000mah battery.Here are pros and cons from my perspective and If you like my review made it helpful so it helps other people as well.And if you want to see its true video I have uploaded on YouTube by ""Gadget Pages"" you can watch there as well.I have uploaded some pictures which can give you idea of its camera.

" DISPLAY=======👍 Infinity display similar to the Galaxy S10 now in M40 }-- Looks like the more expensive Galaxy S10e display👍 6.3” size, with 91.8% screen to body ratio }-- very thin bezels on top and sides👍 PLS LCD display Samsung's proprietary technology }-- Wish it had AMOLED, but PLS LCD offers better viewing angles and higher max brightness👍 Full HD+ resolution 1080x2340 ~409ppi }-- Wide vine L1 certified, runs Amazon Prime videos in true HD👍 Punch Hole notch }-- for me this looks better than regular notches, wallpapers are there to hide the notch ;)PROCESSOR & GPU================👍 Snapdragon 675 Octa-core (2x2.0 GHz Kryo 460 Gold & 6x1.7 GHz Kryo 460 Silver) }-- The latest 6xx series snapdragon processor👍 11nm processor }-- low power usage, battery lasting longer👍 Adreno 612 GPU }-- PUBG runs smoothly in HD graphics with High Frame Rate, Asphalt 9 also runs without any lags and is smooth.STORAGE & RAM===============👍 6 GB RAM }-- no lags in multitasking, was able to run several application and switch between them with ease👍 128 GB Storage🆗  Expandable storage }-- I was able to use the hybrid sim slot for SD cardPROTECTION===========👍  Corning Gorilla Glass protection for display }-- not sure on the version though👎🏻  No IP rating }-- honestly I don't expect a mid-ranger to have IP certifications👍 SAR value 0.200 W/Kg }-- not much radiation, do it's better than brands like XiaomiBATTERY & CHARGING===================👍  3500 mAh Li-Po battery }-- 1 day battery life with normal usage. Can get 5 hours of on-screen time on heavy usage with videos, gaming and mobile data with sync which is very good. Battery optimization is very good.👍  15W charging }-- it just took ~36 minutes to charge from 0% to 50%, but 50% to 100% might take a bit longer.CAMERA=======👍 Triple Rear Camera setup }-- An upgraded and better camera from M30, expecting software updates for better post processing. Current software processing is okay but can be improved as the camera hardware is a good one.👍 32 MP, f/1.7 with PDAF }--  Good day light shots and low light photos were a hit and miss, it's good for this segment but can improve. Am hoping the software updates from Samsung for the camera should make this a lot better and the best in the segment, waiting for them.👍 8MP, f/2.2, 12mm Ultrawide Camera }-- Able to cover a wide area around 123 degree field of view.👍 5MP depth sensor camera }--  edge detection was good in portrait shots.👍 Super Slow motion and Slow motion }-- the super slow-mo videos are superb👍 4K video recording👍 16MP Front Camera }-- Selfies were very good in daylight. The beautify mode is good. Waiting for more updates on the camera post-processing. But this is same as pictures taken from A50 which has a 25MP camera.SOFTWARE & NETWORK=====================👍  ONE UI 1.1 on top of Android 9.0 (Pie) }-- lots of features, simpler, smoother and very clean interface👍  Not much bloatware or no Ads like the Xiaomi's Redmi.👍  Very good Battery optimization, but still can be improved. Expecting updates to further enhance.👍  Has all Indian Bands covered with dual VoLTE.OTHER FEATURES===============🆗 No 3.5 mm headphone jack }-- Only type C earphones can be used or need to use Type-C to 3.5mm adapter but most phones in future will move to Type C earphones👍 Type C earphones provided along with the phone }-- thanks for the earphones👍  On Screen Sound }-- The entire display is the speaker, so while taking call I was able to hear the other person by placing my ear on any part of the display. No worries about earpiece grill and dust. Keep ear on the screen. First time it might take some time to adjust, but soon you might start liking this as you don't need to keep the ear at a specific place.👍  Support Dolby Atmos }-- Very good quality sound from bottom firing speakers, and screen doubles as a speaker too.👍  Rear Finger print reader }-- placed in a good position reachable by the finger and is fast.🆗 No infrared remote, not a deal breaker for me.👍  Bluetooth version 5.0 with A2DP, LE.🆗 Dual tone colored but 2 color options only  }-- I wish there was a red, white and black variant.👍 The phone is just 7.9mm and weighs 168grams. It easy to hold and grip.OVERALL - WORTHY BUY========  :::::::::::::::::::::>> When considering this price segment, the Samsung M40 seems to be the best all rounder.>> Hoping that the the software updates can make the capable camera hardware to do best job and also enhance battery, though am satisfied with the current performance. You can check the pictures i took with the M40 on a gloomy day where sunlight was less.👌🏼 The latest 675 processor, On Screen Sound technology, Dolby Atmos sound, Type C with earphones in the box, triple camera setup, super slow motion, 6GB RAM for multitasking, 128GB on board storage with expandable storage and within Rs.20000 makes this the best budget All-Rounder phone from Samsung.👉 Amazon giving the phone as exclusive and with offers from all major carriers makes is a good move.👌🏼  PUBG and Asphalt runs smooth with HD and High settings makes me happy with the buy. Good to have Snapdragon in the M series.Overall a great budget phone within 20k, the Infinity O Display looks so cool and it looks like a S10e. Though the current display looks very good especially with punch hole notch, I wish the display was AMOLED. And also wish there was a red or white variant and maybe a metallic finish. The phone has touched all areas with a good score.
"
"The M40 has superb screen quality with a flawed ear piece. The phone vibrates during call when the person on the other end of the line speaks. Imagine it as holding a speaker in hand which is buzzing all the time during the conversation. It gives one a feeling tapping your ears to wall while listening to a conversation since there is no ear piece present here. The sound emanates from the screen and fills the phone body and can be felt in your hand holding the phone. The problem is compounded when there is ambient noise making you strain your ears to make sense of the conversation. It makes the basic phone a call conversation outright difficult.The good parts display is very good. The form factor is good to hold.What does the good have to do if you cannot have a basic phone conversation which is easily available in a feature phone.The flaws outweigh the good with the 20k (approx) cost.
"
"The colour reproduction of the display is very bad as display is made of cheap TFT display...battery back up is bad.....and no led notification....call sound and loud speaker sound is not loud......better to purchase redmi note  7 pro...
"
"Reason why I've rated it 1 stars- (After 3 days of use)1) The camera is too noisy and camera software makes it worst. Not good for indoor photography. You will not feel that it has 32MP camera.2) Battery drains like anything. On a Normal usage it will last 12-14 hours.3) The full screen is option is also not good as when you zoom in videos you miss out on up and lower edge details.4) The fingerprint sesnsor is placed so high that you've to search for it many times.5) While the One UI is very clean but it misses basic features offered by others such as gestures, splitscreen, etc.6) Adaptive brightness control is a waste.7) While it says fast charging but it takes a lot of time to charge.8) Lastly PUBG lags.
"
"1. This phone Looks amazing, if you are looking for a phone that looks amazing please go ahead.2. Processor, need to optimize performance, it starts lagging once i started open a few apps.3. 6 gb RAM is enough.4 Battery is ok, I have Moto G5 s plus, 1.5 Year OLD, with 3000 mAh Battery, is better in terms of performance than this one. but screen is sharp and big in this phone so it is considerable.5. Camera is an Average, I will Upload some shots later on. but for now I am not impressed.6. Screen Sound tech is not good at all, it sounds like your speaker is a layer behind so you need to concentrate to listen. this is the only drawback of this phone i came across.7. I was using turbo charger since long, so i am not impressed with this fast charging, its normal for me, not faster than, Motorola turbo charger.8. Came with Type c Port Headphone Jack, this might solve ur problem for now but down the line this is a drawback , that u do not have a head phone with you and you need to borrow from your friend/colleague but they have 3.5mm earphones.9. The Charging Cable.........why Samsung Why...its only 1.79 feet long .....this is not the way to cut the cost....this is deep KANJOOSI. for most of the housed it doesnt cover the distance from Charging socket to the table/bed. tthis is most disturbing fact about this phone.If you are looking for a good phone go with other brands oppo vivo MI etc. but if you want to go with the brand can buy this phone.
"
"I m rating it 2 out of 5. I have no issues regarding the build but Considering the price I expected a better camera, the camera performance is very average it definitely can improve a lot. Would really help if samsung push some updates increasing the camera performance.
"
"Great phone with great specs by great brand. Looks stunning with great memory management and poweful processor. The display is O So Clear. Great battery with OMG standby time. The triple rear camera is good to capture various moments of life. Great replacement for Oneplus X for me 😍😍🤩 It is really OSoLoved. Thanks Samsung for such a O So Wow device with OMG price.

"
"I got this phone as a gift. I like the overall design of the phone and it feels like a premium phone.But when I use the camera on this device, I see flickering of the screen and it is extremely evident even in the video playback. This is ridiculous when you are marketing this device with one of the USP being a great camera.Now, I understand that some devices may be faulty. But the return experience should be seamless for the users. When I called Amazon, I've been told that someone will need to come inspect the phone and then decide if they will replace it. I find that very annoying again. Why should I wait for a replacement when something is evidently wrong with the phone? Can I just not send a video of using it to prove its faulty?User experience is not what I imagined it to be. Unlke in USA, the service here is lacking by Amazon!

"Battery backup is too low

"1. Display quality is just below average, though touch response is good2. Call quality is very poor, voice of the person speaking from other side is barely audible. I mean come on this is the most basic thing we expect from a mobile phone to do, don't understand why have they used this screen sound casting technology3. For me non existence of 3.5 mm headphone jack is just not a big deal
"
"Good to use
"
"Moving back my trusted Samsung after 3years. M 40 Speed is good and the camera & picture quality is awesome. I am a bit worried about the battery life. I guess this phone needs a 4000 mAh. 4 star only becoz there is scope for improvement.
"
"Before buying i should have gone for A50....!
"
"Camera quality is very poor, bad camera, not satisfied with camera qualtiy
"
"Phone looks good and very nice.Battery not okay they should give 4000 or some good battery optimisation.Display not bad while campring between amold and other LCD, this is not okay. Because we came across brand trust but now that is not there.Performance it's okay mid range only.Why Snapdragon processors while others (moto)are using Samsung processors?And in my display bottom of navigation bar some light dark shadow is there inside display And inifnity O circle also having se dark shadow.This is defect or design I'm not sure..Phone is good but okay to this price. 20k they can give good quality phone
"
"Phone is good but camera not good don't buy this phone

"Fingerprint reader is really fast and smooth, battery is really great and the best part is the screen overall it's the best phone from Samsung and I really recommend it.

"Build quality is great and OneUI is clean; and that's where the liking for this phone will end.What you will not like:_ Poor camera._ No 3.5mm headphone jack._ No AMOLED display. But the picture quality is good._ No warm colour setting in the phone! There's a night mode. But it just makes the system UI dark instead of light. Like the ""Light"" or ""Dark"" mode in Windows 10. Cheaper phones have warm colour mode for blue light filter. OneUI on flagship models have a Screen Mode option, where you can set the White Balance slider to cool or warm. Although M40 has OneUI, there's no such option. I don't understand why. May be cost cutting. But how?_ On call voice clarity is bad. Especially, if you're outside in traffic, you will not be able to hear most of the conversation.Honest opinion - M40 is not really worth 20k. Chinese brands offer more value for money and that too below 15k.
"
"The phone is amazing I very much like this phone and the  camera is amazing I like it

"Very great product from SamsungI am loving this phoneMust buy

"Mobile was good .
"
"Pathetic camera!The phone has a stunning display, excellent performance and an average batter but camera is the worst. Its not worth the money. I saw all reviews and expected camera to be average but reality is it is worse.
"
"Good sleek design, size just perfect for holding in one hand, neither too large nor to small, great screen to phone ratio, good UI easy to use & access apps, however  icons could have been slightly  smaller, screen sound tech is average but u need to get used to it & identify the right spot to place your eardrum but large uninterrupted  screen compensates  for the average screen sound tech.Sound quality is awesome with Dolby atmos feature for earphones, with a c type earphone Jack the sound is awesome treat for ears, the camera are good but the deal breaker is wide screen camera of this phone, the videos & pics taken in wide screen mode are like very very good. Other than that for tik tik lover some gr8 effects are provided also with slow mo & super slomo effects.Fingerprint  touch sensor works perfectly fine, while face lock feature work good,  only off is that after it reads your face and unlocks the phone still have to slide it to actually  arrive at your home page, maybe with further updates it will get sorted. Battery life is one& a half day with average usage no gaming.
"
"Very nice phone. The only issue i am facing is about my phone has been restarted few times automatically wjile using . I hope this bug shall go away with coming updates. Rest all is going very smooth till now..

"Ordered during first sale and first time user of Samsung mobile phone,fell into the trap of hype created around m40 and totally dissatisfied with the product.facing lot of heating issue right from day 1 ..literally cannot touch the screen or take the call getting near to my ear..the basic functionality of phone is of no use then why should I buy this phone.the call quality is very bad had to repeat twice,battery back up is very bad.all in all a very bad experience and  regretting.absolutely not getting any support from Amazon
"
"Smartphone feels smooth in touch and in operating,  battery life needs to charge if used for prolong time and take about 15-20 minutes for charging it in normal state , by the way who wants to spend whole day and night with phone lol M40 is light weight ,it does help in gaming for entertainment purposes then throw it aside not to get addicted to games. Camera is good , finger print touch unlock is very quick I didn't find any lag if I find any problem with this I'll update , there is Dolby Atmos use wireless bluetooth earbuds move around keeping phone at one place good range of bluetooth,  when phone is locked there is screensaver of glance showing different information good for learning new things without searching, overall above average below premium level.
"

"Never buy samsung M40Its speaker is very bad quality....no clear sound when someone call us......totally west of mony.....koe free me de tabh bhi mat lena...

"
"Very poor performance.
"
"It's an amazing phone🖤❤️❤️❤️💖
"
"Phone is good but sound quality is not good...Rest is fine...
"
"Overall it's a good phone in this budget but major issues are, it has LCD Display so the sharpness of images is poor as compared to the 32MP camera, secondly- removing ear piece and using Screen Sound Technology is the worst thing...Volume during calls is too low and you can't hear properly, so it's the worst thing you can have in this phone. Also battery drains little faster as compared to other phones. It's good to buy but could be much more better !

"This time Samsung really try to do some thing new and special with Galaxy M series and you will admire that.The Samsung Galaxy M40 brings a lot of interesting features and changes in the previous Galaxy M series of Smartphones.Galaxy M40 has three major highlights in my view1. Infinity O Display/Punch hole Display2. Hardware(Screen Sound Technology, On Board features)3. Triple CamerasThanks to this Galaxy M40 should be the most affordable smartphone to feature a Punch hole Display and I Love it. The punch on is on the left here. But, it still gives the M40 a very S10e while and It sure looks good. Now so like the subtle transitions on the punch or when you use face lock or when you open up the selfie cap. Now it's really cool and this means the Galaxy M40 looks great from the front. So, thanks to the punch hole this is a good looking smartphone now.What would have made better things even better is an AMOLED display like the other Galaxy M series. But, sadly that wasn't to be this. Here is a Bezel-Less 6.3"" FHD+ 2340X1080P PLS TFT LCD display with 91.8% usable Screen to body Ratio and protection of Corning Gorilla Glass V3. Immersive 19.5:9 screen ratio seems pretty good and looks wider in viewing video files. The display has vibrant colours and it's pretty bright. Overall a very pleasing display not ambulant but definitely decent. I also like the brightness of the display. So even If you know you're someone who uses your phone outdoors a lot in bright sunlight. You really wouldn't have lot of problems reading in bright sunlight.The next highlight of the Galaxy M40 is it's Hardware.Samsung Galaxy M40 comes with the Snapdragon 675 processor and Adreno 612 GPU with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of Internal storage and it expandable upto 512GB. I'm using 400GB Micro SD card for saving my Personal files like Photos, Videos, Musics, Movies, Backups etc... Phone works perfectly after installing 400GB SD Card.Now the specs sound awesome for a Samsung mid-range right for a long time. Samsung's budget and Mid-range smartphones have been marred by underpart processors and the Galaxy M40 with the Snapdragon 675.Samsung Galaxy M40 has been smooth and nice for me in day to day tasks which is great. But I know you're wondering about gaming on the Galaxy M40. Adreno 612 GPU enhance the performance while gaming. The PUBG Mobile runs on high graphic settings default and game plays fairly smooth and nice. It's a good news for all PUBG lovers. Snapdragon 675 the performance definitely seems positive on Galaxy M40.This phone did not have traditional ear piece. So, the call quality is important for this device. This device comes with a Screen Sound Technology which the Screen vibrates the audio range to produce sound. While calling, You can place your ear in anywhere of the screen and You can here the voice. The call sound quality is good.The last highlight is the Triple Camera setup. It's not the same triple camera setup as the previous Galaxy M30. These ones are in upgraded. There's a 32 megapixel F/1.7 Aperture Primary camera and 8 megapixel F/2.2 123° ultra wide angle camera and 5 megapixel F/2.2 Live focus camera. Samsung also includes a Flash in rear . M40 can record 4k videos at 30fps and Super Slow-mo videos at 240fps. It also have super slow-mo and hyper lapse video recording options . Video is very stable and its quality is decent. Front camera its the usual 16 megapixel F/2.0 Aperture camera. Selfies and photos captured in rear cameras are good right the sharp and well detailed.Overall I like the fact of the Galaxy M40 comes with ultra wide angle lens. But apart from that I've really sure on the primary camera of the Galaxy M40. Because, I've always liked the Cameras on Samsung's phones and M40 is decent too due to the details and consistency is kind of surprise. Hopefully Samsung did a great job.Apart from that you get the usual buttons, the fingerprint scanner on the back, the USB C port. There is one thing missing. The head phone jack is gone now. This is rather bad news for budget smartphone buyers. But at least Samsung bundles USB C earphones with the phone. Anyway on the softly from the Galaxy M40 comes with OneUI on top of Android 9 Pie onboard which makes it the first smartphone in the M series to come with OneUI. This is the proper OneUI with the OneUI features, The features I'm talking about is the one-handed usage friendly UI which is something I really like very cool dark mode of navigation gestures and more plus the phone comes with the Android 9 features like detail well being. The Galaxy M40 seems pretty sorted on the software front now all that is good. This phone comes with Dolby Atmos mode that can be enabled only after you've plugged in your earphones. You'll really feel the difference in the sound quality.The fingerprint sensor, Which I really prefer over any in display fingerprint sensors for ease of use. But, which are slow and unpredictable. The Galaxy M40 has the fastest fingerprint sensor and It placed pretty appropriately as well. It have a face unlock as well which works equally well and I would prefer this even over the fingerprint sensor. In terms of building design the device is a very good size and it fits very well in hand, Not too heavy and feels really well balanced. At the back camera unit does elevate a little, But that doesn't seen like much of problem. It's all plastic which keeps the weight light. However it doesn't feel cheap or poor quality despite the low price point.Moving on to the batteries, The Galaxy M40 comes with a 3500mAh battery which does sound a bit modest and Samsung bundled a 15w fast charging adaptor on it. This charger charges the phone from 10% to 50% in around 30 minutes.Apart from that the phone has a hybrid sim slot. So you can either use dual sims or a sim card with a micro sd card well. This phone supports 512 GB additional Micro SD Card support. And the both Sim Slots supports Jio VoLTE.An another feature I like in this phone was, Every time you unlock you present it with a lock screen that contains a story. Now these lock screen stories change each time you lock and unlock your display. You can get more information about that particular lock screen story and you could flip or you could slide to access more of these. There's actually a setting inside lock screen. Where you could go to lock screen stories setting and you can choose categories from where you do want this feed or you can turn it off completely.Finally I would still go ahead and say that it does offer excellent value for money. So, If you want to stretch your budget and you're looking for a phone from one of the best smartphone makers around the world the Galaxy M40 is probably your answer for that. So, thats it from me. Hope you're enjoyed the review. If you've got any questions you can leave them in comment section below and I'm going to answer them to my best capacity.Thank you

"This is waste of money.  I got a  defective product with camera lens broken.  Still didn't got replacement. Please don't buy this. Battery life is very short. Discharge in just 2 hrs.Requested for inspection.Technician was rude. Instead of resolving the problem he began to convince me that I damaged my phone.  Why would I do that?.He updated that there is no issue with my phone and that everything is okay.When I contacted him and asked the same,  he began to use abusive language.  I told him that I requested for another inspection.  Then he threatened me that he would make sure that I will never get a replacement .His name is  Madhu CholletiPhone number is  9494604371

"After two days,Phone looks fabulous.Build quality very very good.Speed superb.Camera very good but front camera has on screen flash which is bad.Samsung has done so far but did compromise with battery. Battery drains fast though it stays a day long on very normal usage. Though it got fast charging , very very fast charging.

"This phone is the best phone in this price segment.I like the most about it is its infinity o display which gives a luxurious feeling. Camera quality is awesome.Speed is amazing.Everything is good.Some people are blaming that its battery is only 3500 mah but it is sufficient for whole day at least for me.

"
"It looks absolutely stunning when it comes to design and performance. However I am a bit disappointed with its battery backup. I bought it couple of days back and will be evaluating it further.
"
"Poor quality phone for the price tag.  Disappointed with buy
"
"Overall it's very good product. Simple, elegant and fun to use. I didn't come across any big drawback or problem with this phone but on-screen audio is little bit problematic, when ambient sounds/noice is high it gets difficult to hear properly through screen.

"Please don't buy this phone because face lock very slow and front camera so so.

"
"This is in reference to Samsung M40 i have received on 22nd juneFirstly There is white spot on the camera Front camera .Secondly if we are paying such a high amount of almost 20k should we expect a quality that is Good or superior than the predecessor M30But its not .This is really very disappointing that a premium brand like samsung is sending a New defective products .This is really very annoying , and certainly i have changed my decision and i dont  want this product anymore and please hardly request change my model also M40Say M30Other wise I’m go to consumer countPlease Assist accordinglyThanks and RegardsBharat Lahoti
"
"The phone is fast, the face unlock and the touch have decent feedback, probably could tweek the touch response time but nothing to worry much about, the display is amazing and colorful and the phone though has a big screen is kind of sleek to hold on too, also supports one handed user interface, so thats a plusBattery is fine for me, it lasts a day and a half, I'm not into hardcore gaming, even if i do play, probably and hour or so of pubg mobile or fortnite mobile, although I'm connected youtube and social media all the time  the battery has been really decent, the camera quality is supreme, natural light photographs are the best, i really like the wide angle camera, also i don't really need to click low light photographs so low light photography performance dosen't matter.The no headphone jack is fine for me too, since I'm mostly connected via bluetooth headsets, rarely used wired ones in my old handset too, so dont miss it as such, however samsung has done nice to provide Type C headphones in the box. I would have loved if they would have provided a transparent case with the handset too.
"
"Waste of moneyVery poor customer serviceNot answer properlyI am go to consumer court
"
"Samsung has provided a Very poor quality front camera. It seems to be VGA Camera to me.Phone heats a lot. And the sound quality while talking is horrible. You have to check again and again if the sound volume is appropite or not.
"
"Samsung Galaxy M40 appears to be a descent phone.It has a respectable camera and looks stylish.And all the features are superb.
"
"Not at all upto the mark, I never write negative reviews, probably first negative review I am writing, I gifted it to my wife on her bday, she did not like this phone at all and purchased the new one, the selfie quality is extremely bad, battery life is not at all good, no option to capture screenshot using three fingers, the screenshot functionality is very complex! This phone not worth 20k, I am extremely disappointed as she have used it just for 3-4 days and purchased a new oppo phone. I know amazon cannot do anything but it's my suggestion to everyone to not to buy any new launched phone until it is oppo, vivo, oneplus or redmi. Worst ever decision to invest my money on this phone as it proved to be worst ever gift I gifted to my wife.
"
"The phone works well. I had some issues with getting the sim tray to open. the one complaint about the product is that the call volume is pretty low and the camera quality is not as promised.
"
"Amazing ... 😍
"
"Camera performance not up to the mark, disappointed
"
"The camera quality is indeed fabulous along with the new UI interface. Not to forget that the processor is immersive and powerful and the lifetime of the battery for that matter does give you a day's backup but it could've been more. Altogether, a great budget device and you should Go for it!
"
"Screen sound technology is failure,poor sound quality....
"
"Sound quality is very bad,I was using samsung  J7 maxx and had high hopes with this phone but feel disappointed.
"
"Good
"
"The phone is just average not value for money. Other brand mobiles available with such features at a very low price. Screen protection & protective cover not provided in box neither it's available in market or online.
"
"Very poor sound on earpiece,technology upgradation does not mean quality compromise.Entire mobile vibrates when receive the call.feels very irritating.However speaker ok.Battery still compromising.Want to return, if possible.
"
"Battery quality is very poor
"
"Everythingis too good except battery life and handsfree jackIf battery were 5000mAH then its a unbeatable phone for every other companies.
"
"Good phone, camera colors can be bit vibrant.
"
"After using two days its light sensor is not working and phone is heating. I registered a complaint to Amazon. I hope they replaced this defective device.
"
"Rear camera  camera is poor quality  . sound is very low and worst quality . i sam purchasing  through amazon . it is delivered  very  WROST MOBLILE  M 40 samsung .
"
"I like the displayOver Beutification in front cam...
"
"I lyk the phone it is very good look wise and battery performance is also good.
"
"Fantastic mobile. Best camera in this range. Screen sound technology is good.
"
"There is lack in this phone . The camera is not upto the mark . It is 32 mp camera but its seems like only 12 mp camera. The Phone is very fast n has very large storage thats n attractive point but we can buy other phones with almost better or same features at a better price than this. We should go for poco F1 or Galaxy A50 insted of Galaxy M40.
"
"Very nice mobile back camera is very good  , front camera and battery backup is ok , radiation level sar value is very low so it is safe for children also
"
"Touch and speed of operation are excellent
"
"Best in design,best in camera ,but battery drain faster and also charge faster , overall best phone under 20k ,go for it
"
"product is good up to now
"
"Very Good phone in this price range.Lot Happy with phones performance so farCamera quality is highlight of this phone, it clicks great picture even in low lightFace unlock works faster than i could have imaginedGood display quality (As i watch lots of web series on my phone so liked it more)On my personal view it would have been great if fingerprint reader were on front side (although on back side is not an issue)Battery life is is just good as it is just 3500 mAh, could have been better phone with 4000-5000 mAh, as in this age were people spend most of their time on phone so this could have given us extra few hours before we plug in charger.HAPPY WITH OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF SAMSUNG M40
"
"Awesome Phone
"
"First i thought I got a defective  product  with poor front camera clarity and battery life as I received the mobile very next day of launch, also the product review was blocked initially.. During  the replacement  transit, I understood  the camera quality  and battery  life by default very very poor by reading  other  user reviews. Now I got my replacement  and thinking  to resell it as the battery  isn't  with stands till evening with default  apps and moderate  usage. Completely unhappy with the outcome  and not at all worth for 20000. Pls don't buy it.
"
"Wonderful product according to price
"
"I got this product with tempered glass recommended on Amazon's website (Comoro).The tempered glass doesn't fit & covers the front camera.Samsung shouldn't release products if they cannot provide accessories.Amazon shouldn't show false pictures if they do not have the right fits.
"
"This is amazing phone
"
"No headphone jack,nice if it had 4000 mah battery
"
"Samsung galaxy M40 has amazing display with full hd infinity -O display.  Processor is strong so it works smoothly . Battery is 3500 MAH which is enough still 4000 would be better.  Fingerprint scanner is not that good.  It take time to unlock when device is sleeping.Overall its a nice device I like it .
"
"Camera quality very worst in detailing
"
"During Incoming calls phone screen remains off , sometimes flash light not work , sometimes fingerprint sensor also not work please tell me is it with every handset or m special .
"
"Excellent phone and quality
"
"This is very good phone which is reasonable jn budget...  has good speaker screen technology .... camera quality is awesome where we can make slow motion and super slow motion videos...... camera clarity is toooo good..... overall battery life is very less when compared to other 3500 mah battery phones...
"
"Everything is perfect
"
"Plz avoid buying ....1 ) you might not hear the voice clearly, or you might hear echoes, crackling from the other side. 2) phone is heating up very badly...My suggestion  is Company has to recall all these phones, or else it impact on entire brand. All users facing issues mainly call, if it's basic functionality  of the  call voice not working,  keeping the is waste.. samsung has to recall the phone and repay the money, if not repaying  the money to users it impacts entire  Samsung brand, users never buy the mobiles in Amazon.
"
"Hi All....I hope this review would be helpful for someone looking ""Samsung's  OMG M40"".M40 have used their marketing logo OMG but nothing is there as a wow  factor except sound screen technology.1.Performance wise it's good with SNAPDRAGON 675 ,6GB RAM,128 GB ROM and finger print sensor is too fast compared with A50. 5/52. Display is not so good when u compare it with samsung's OLED display.When a HD video is compared with samsung A50 display,it has the reality feeling and OLED is stunning...Not happy with LCD display..3/53. Battery is charging fast but 3500 mAh is less it seems.4/5 Due to fast charging it's better.4. Camera is not so great but ok nothing as wow factor. Front camera over expose u and u looks great...Rear camera seems to be good and yet have not taken any natural scenery hope samsung camera works good in daylight. 3.5/55. Design and look is good. But I personally feel punch hole display makes an awkward look. 4/56.Sound is really good and equals to 1 plus6Wish samsung would launch something wow under 20k..so u people can wait or go with M40.
"
"The Worst Phone ever....it has a big big big Heat issue......very low low battery life.......i played pubj for just 30 minute and i have to leave the game in mid way...because the screen is likely to burn my thumb....please guys dont buy this.....and yes the screen sound cast technology is just f***

"Very poor battery life ....no fast charging....touchscreen sometimes hang ..  please do go for it ..if you are looking for performance

"At this price, along with a brand value  of Samsung, a perfect piece of cellphone one can have. Fully equipped with latest faetures available in market. Cons get diminished in front of pros.
"
"Don't buy this phone only design is good, othr than that not upto the mark, camera also not good

"Cheap product ever by Samsung dnt buy this without super amoled display

"The camera quality is good and the battery life is not as long as previous M series mobile but the main part of this mobile is its processor which is Snapdragon 675 and overall performance is good . If you are going for M series go for galaxy M40.

"Fingerprint reader and battery life is good or i would say amazing.Just facing issue with camera quality , the ultra wide angle make me happy but the captured photos colour are not natural. It seems whitish... though I'm sure Samsung will give an update on it.Overall I'm  very happy  with the M40.

"READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO BUY M40.Hey, guys bought this phone in the second sale and I have bought the seawater blue variant (6GB RAM + 128GB  ROM) which is priced for Rs 19990.*It comes in a typical Samsung packaging and inside the box you will get the M40, Charging brick, USB Type C cable, Type C earphones, user manual, Sim ejector pin. (images attached)*Build quality of the phone is good it is having a good finishing and the form factor of this phone is also very compact and lightweight with the thickness of 7.9mm and weighing 168 grams.*The rear panel of M40 looks similar to the previous M series phones, the seawater blue variants looks great and if you want a deep colour then you can go for the deep blue variant. The rear side of this phone attracts fingerprint and dust easily it will be better to use with a back cover.*In the rear panel, you will get the fingerprint scanner, triple camera setup (it is placed on top left corner).*In the front you will get the punch hole display like S10 and there is no earpiece but you will get the On Screen Sound technology which means the sound is delivered from under display (this is done to reduce the bezels).*In the top there is secondary noise cancellation mic and in the bottom type C port and the speaker grill is placed.DISPLAY used in M40 is FHD+ display and the viewing experience is great well many people are disappointed that AMOLED is not used, the AMOLED display is missing to reduce the cost of this phone. On-screen sound technology is used to increase the screen to body ratio.*As said earlier the viewing angles are great and under the sunlight, the display is crisp and sharp. It is also having widevine L1 certification with the help of that you can stream HD contents in Amazon Prime, Netflix etc.PERFORMANCE this the first Samsung M phone to feature Snapdragon 675 & it is clocked at 2 GHz, it is having 6GB RAM and it makes multitasking on this phone very snappy.GAMING EXPERIENCE nowadays we are very obsessed with PUBG Mobile (Default settings is HD Graphics with high frame rate) and the gameplay is quite good without any frame drops  Screenshot attached. Other games like Asphalt 8 & 9 works greatSOFTWARE EXPERIENCE Out of the box you will get the One UI and Android Pie in this phone as the One UI is very well optimized you will get good user experience. There are few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo you can uninstall them easily. Features of One UI like Blue Light filter is missing but with future software updates, it might get added in this phone.STORAGE it is having a storage of 128 GB according to me for an individual it is quite enough for downloading Series, Music, storing photos, movies etc and if you want to expand the storage you can extend it up to 512 GB with Micro SD card.SOUND OUTPUT from the speaker grill is crisp & clear and sound from On screen sound during the calls are great.LETS TALK ABOUT ITS CAMERA it features a triple rear camera with 32-megapixel primary camera with f/1.7 aperture, an 8-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123-degree FoV, and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You can also record videos with the wide-angle camera this feature is not available in flagships like OnePlus 7 Pro.It clicks great photos in daylight and in low light the picture quality is great & it does not struggle in low light like other budget segment cameras. (Added few camera samples)In the front, there is a 16 Megapixel camera which is present in the punch hole display and it takes good selfies.The autofocus is quite fast and the shutter speed is fast too. Switching to a wide angle lens is very easy with just a tap of the button.BATTERY PERFORMANCE—It is loaded with 3500 mAh battery which can last for the whole day if you are a normal user and if you are a gamer then at the end of the day you might end up charging up the phone. But with basic usage, the battery will last for the whole day.It comes with a 15w charging adapter and it can charge up the phone from 0% to 100% in 1hr 30 mins.Now let me start with the pros and cons of this device:-PROS—1) It comes with a punch hole display (infinity O) which flagships like S10 is having and it looks great.2) On-screen sound technology the sound comes from the display, as a result, there are less bezels.3) The triple rear camera and the photos clicked are of great quality.4) You can also record videos with the wide angle lens (which is currently not present in many flagships).5) You can get chicken dinner easily with this phone Adreno 612 helps to get good performance in gaming.6) It comes with a widevine L1 certification many budget segment phones fail to deliver this feature.7) Dolby Atmos, NFC is present.8) You are getting the latest software Samsung ONE UI & Android Pie.9) It supports fast charging and in the box, you are getting a fast charger.10) Snapdragon 675 and 6 GB RAM which gives a good day to day performance.11) Internal Storage is 128GB which is enough for storing movies, songs, photos etc.12) It is very lightweight and slim(168 gms & 7.9MM thick).13) It comes with a hybrid sim slot.14) The seawater blue looks great and premium.15) With the brand value of Samsung the after sales service is also great.16) There are many launch offers from many operators.Cons—1) Well Samsung has ditched 3.5mm jack but in the box, you are getting a type C earphones, there will be a problem for those people who are willing to use their old 3.5mm earphones, you need to buy an extra type C to 3.5mm adapter which is not that comfortable.2) The rear side attracts dust, fingerprints and it is prone to scratches better to buy a back cover to save the rear side of your from scratches or falls.3) It comes with a few pre-installed apps like Daily hunt, Helo but you can uninstall them easily.VERDICT—If you want a budget phone with infinity O display, good camera, fast charging, Great software & good performance then you can buy this phone without giving a second thought.Thank you for reading my review.Regards,Nishant Lala

"Fingerprint sensor is good to catch ur fingers print. Camera quality is good and its blur quality is also good. Nice phone
"
"The only reason why I'm giving a rating of 4 to this handset is, it has a c-type pin for headset and the extension cables for normal headphone Jack to c-type doesn't work in this handset when they're connected!
"

"

"Battery life would have been better.
"
"Been using the phone for 3 days now and this is the basic idea I have about it.1. Camera with Gcam does wonders.2. Really smooth and the 6GB RAM with SD675 ensure a smooth experience.3. It takes time getting used to sound on screen technology, though it could be better.4. The speakers sound nice.5. Battery life is as expected and with moderate use, it lasts a day.OVERALL I'D SUGGEST THIS PHONE TO PEOPLE WHO WANT PERFORMANCE WITH A BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY

"
"The mobile is handy and good . But the cameras are not as expected in portrait mode  and front facing camera. The battery is meant ok. Not enthralled but satisfied  with the M40 as it has snap 675 and others software features compared to A50 and other mobile and it would be better of Samsung  would have gone for AMOLED. Almost no others flaws but samsung flunked to give AMOLED and better camera quality and battery.
"
"Only design rating is 5 star, Camera quality is 3rd class, i want return this device and I want my money back , in Rs.13999 redmi note 7 pro is best camera

"Display is fine and the overall performance is very much appreciating because of the snapdragon processor.Rear Camera is Excellent.Headphone jack is C type So unique feature is available unlike M30.
"
"Overall performance of the phone is impressive. It's quite fast and responsive. Sleek design and o infinity display add more desirability and excellence to the phone. Highlighting the positive points, Camera works amazing in both rear and primary, Fast Charging going fine, speaker and Type c earphones are premium in quality terms. But comparing the phone with other samaung mid range phones it lacks samsung knox secure features where no option is available to the users for masking apps and or secure their contents in secure folders. Samsung pay option is also missing in the phone. Rest, phone is attractive, feels premium, No heating issues while using or on charging.Except 2-3 down points mentioned above phone is stellar and worth buying.

"
"Video quality  very poor
"
"The most pertinent issue I'm facing is with the quality of Phone calls. It strains my ear to actually listen to what the other person is trying to communicate. Moreover, its impossible to have a conversation when outdoors.The other issue is with the quality of camera, both front and rear. The front camera clicks worse pictures than a sub standard 10k phone. The rear camera clicks the dullest possible pictures in every lighting condition. Moreover, the rear camera does neither captures details nor does it focus.

"Kindly read this review if you are planning to buy this product.I was very excited when Samsung was launching the M40 as it was packed with lots of premium features and specs at a budget rate and I was not at all disappointed.There were many reviews but none of them were helpful. So, I'm gonna write everything about the product in this review.*For those who don't know about the M series, It is an attempt by the Korean brand to capture the budget smartphone segment, which is dominated by Xiaomi in India. Let's see if they are successful in it.Design & Display-*The M40 has a premium body design with a glossy dual tone effect, which is one of the highlights of the device.*Comes in 2 beautiful colors, though I wish there were more.*It features an Infinity O or Punch hole display, a segment first, which was seen only on a flagship like the S10 amounting more than 50k.*It stands out from the crowd as it looks really cool and futuristic.*The screen to body ratio is 91%.*The Full Hd resolution is a treat to your eyes.*It has Corning Gorilla Glass.*It's incredibly light when compared to all metal body phones out there.*It has a hybrid card slot and dual 4G sim slots.*Another coolest thing about the phone is the On-Screen Sound Technology, which transforms the whole screen into a speaker and thereby increasing the screen to body ratio.Performance-*It comes with the Snapdragon 675 processor, the latest 6 series processor from Qualcomm.*The phone is capable of handling multitasking as well as day-to-day tasks.*The battery will easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage.*On a daily basis, I watched videos, played games, using social media, messaging apps, making calls as well as listened to music online.*Gaming is really good. Thanks to the Adreno 612 GPU.*PUBG on the phone is really amazing and fast. The default setting is HD graphics and high frame rate which works flawlessly.*The storage is expandable up to 512GB.Camera-*M40 features a 32MP triple camera rear shooter with a focal length of F1.7 which is really cool.*F1.7 helps in getting good low light photographs.*It features an 8MP Ultra-Wide Lens for a 123-degree field of view to capture exactly what your eye can view.*Dedicated 5MP depth sensor for amazing portrait shots.*A 16MP front camera to get those crisp and beautiful selfies.*It has slow-motion, super slow motion, hyper-lapse, 4K video recording, and many more features.*It has an AI-based scene optimizer.*I'm impressed by the camera quality of this 20K price range phone. (Check the sample Images uploaded)*The photos clicked with the rear camera are crisp, detailed and color reproduction is impressive. In bright outdoors, depth of field effect on both the front and rear cameras can produce some great results.*I’m waiting to add google camera and see the results.Operating System-*It's coming with OneUI with Android Version 9 Pie.*I personally like the look and feel of the OS which is simple and smooth.*I guess the phone will be getting one or two major Android updates in the future.Battery-*It comes with a 3500mAH lithium-ion battery.*It supports Fast charging.*Comes with 15W Type C Fast charger.Other Points-*Fingerprint Scanner and Face Unlock works flawlessly.*Comes with Type C earphones in the box and the quality of the earphones are really good.*It gives great entertainment benefits with Widevine L1 and Dolby Atmos.*Comes with all necessary sensors like Accelerometer, Fingerprint Sensor, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Hall Sensor, Proximity Sensor, Virtual Light Sensing, etc.Overall Verdict-*The M40 features a first in segment infinity display, unique design, good performance, good battery life, a hybrid card slot, and a competitive price which makes it the best smartphone in the 20K range.*The value for money pricing can give a tight competition to Xiaomi and other phones in this price range.*If you've any queries regarding the product or its working, feel free to contact me. Happy to help.*Hope this was Helpful.Happy Shopping :)

"Product is good, Audio quality  need to be improved as sound is surrounding during call

"Heating, battery drain vary fast, not locking good, Camara quality very bad don't buy this mobile. Please refund my money
"
"This phone has all features of premium smartphones, this phone only lack behind in 3.5mm headphone Jack, 4000mah battery and super amoled display, and there can be 2 sim or 1 sim with 1 memory card so I expect there should be 2 sim slot with one memory card slot
"
"It's really OMGScreen, Camera, Battery everything is great

"This is a perfect device feom samsung. The phone camera is 32 M but picture quality seems to be ok. But in this range this is best phone.Touch is very smooth.Amazon same day delivery by paying 100 rs is worth.
"
"Great phone. Good display yet not the best. Good rear camera and an average front camera. Performance is really nice. Games or apps you wont have any complains from performance but with great performance i don't know why the lacked behind in battery. Not so great battery life. Drains quickly and i believe samsung needs to do something with this. Fingerprint sensor can be fast but face unlock works like a charm. Could have bundled cover for the phone. If they provide an update that can increase the life of battery this would be a wonderful phone
"
"Very nice
"
"The camera quality of this phone is third class.. the photo size is in kb from 32 mega pixel camera which will be very low quality.. there is no option to change the camera resolution
"
"Camera quality is very good,  battery backup is not good, picture quality is average.
"
"Ok good
"
"Good phone with smoother performance, great screen, good innovation of screen voice without earpiece, clear voice.... I would recommend this phone to buy. It would be great experience and u won't regret after purchasing it... camera is also good with decent pictures, surprisingly performs fine even in low light, however there is no night mode given there, even there are good results in night pictures...
"
"Only i disappointed  with battery  backup ..so here could u 5000mah battery  give it..its will be very useful .
"
"Worst camera quality

"it's best, unexpected, and awesome mobile for low budget. over all good . and Samsung is always given best quality to the customer .
"
"Despite its battery capacity and lack of 3.5mm jack, everything else was more than awesome.The phone is extremely good looking and speed is incredible. It is not only handling multiple tasks easily but also not getting over heat on over usage.I love this phone
"
"If anybody already used Samsung higher end phones then I would recommend don't buy it. Processor is big but phone is too slow and lacks many times.Second of all camera is 32 mp but quality of photos is like ordinary. Some can definitely tell that photo is not from high quality camera. Also camera is very slow to process.The build quality is moderate. Face detection is slow.takes around 3-4 sec.to open.The only thing I like is the screen size. Huge and impressive.
"
"Touch is very smooth
"
"Cons:1. Battery life is too low2. Voice quality is not good since there is no earpiece, you can feel the vibrations in screen during calls.3. Poor camera especially front, can't believe it's Samsung4. Fast charging is a joke compared to competition.5. Older processor (675)6. Slower fingerprint unlockOverall all cost cutting by Samsung except the display. Even charger cable is shorter.I had Oppo F9 pro (2018) and M40 is clearly a downgrade from Oppo's older and cheaper model. Shame on Samsung.Not satisfied. And the best part is, you cannot return!
"
"Samsung Galaxy m40 it is very good phone very nice looking very beautiful very fast
"
"Its phone very light wait and touch is very soft and yes vslue for money
"
"In my opinion, it is an ultimate smartphone below 20k range. It has come with many firsts to be a landmark for others to follow. It is for the first time that infinity O display has been launched in this price range of phones. So far it is in S10 that is in a much higher price range. Screen to body ratio is phenomenal. It is more than 91%. FHD+ resolution is an experience to cherish in itself. For me, it is a great viewing experience whether it comes to movies, videos, or pictures. No stress on eyes while watching longer videos.Performance wise, it is giving a tough challenge to many higher priced smartphones in the market. It is the first M series smartphone from Samsung that has a Snapdragon processor that too, the latest 6 series from Qualcomm. High-end gaming is easily possible on M40 because of Adreno 612 GPU.I am fond of taking pictures. For me, this phone, therefore, is a superstar. It has triple rear camera. The main one is 32 megapixels with F1.7. Pictures are as lively and natural as they can be. Low light photography is at its best with M40. Video recording is almost professional with M40 with features like slow motion, super slow motion, and hyper-lapse. For me, it is a great experience with M40.Sound quality is excellent. Dolby Atmos makes it theatre like experience. For calls, it uses on-screen sound technology.It comes with the latest Android OS - Pie. UI is an unmatched experience.With type C charger it charges quite fast and the battery lasts longer despite full day heavy utilization.

"Very nice
"
"Worst phone , 1out of 5 never buy this phone
"
"I was hesitating to purchase a Samsung phone but after a lot of review, I've decided to go for M40. I must tell you that this phone looks so cool in your hands with that premium look and punch hole display. Display is the biggest plus for this phone.Tou can feel the difference between exynos and Snapdragon processor clearly. My friend has got Samsung A50 on which I see a slight noticable lag when opening the apps..but M40 is much smoother and faster.Battery is not draining fast...but 4000 mah would have been better.

"Display quality, Camera quality, Internal Memory, Processor quality, RAM, Face unlock facility (which works great). You name and it is there in best possible specification in this phone. I cannot expect more in Rs. 20,000.Better than any other phone of any company in this price range.Battery could have been better but human wishes never end. Still I think power consumption of this phone is low. I spend only 60% from morning to evening with brightest display settings. No need to think twice if you plan to buy this phone. I am happy that I decided to buy it.

"Right now I have some query about my recent order , as per  Samsung M 40 ,the mobile come along with 15v fast charger but when I checked with chargerdetails it's shows only 5v.  Today I check with Samsung till free noregarding this and my handset also get hot when this is only 2 days old.I will give full review and update once corrdinate with Samsung till freeno or local authrise dealer.
"
"Camera quality is not appropriate, rathere then this everything is great.
"
"Phone having heating while speaking.Audio sound while speaking is bad.
"
"Best
"
"It gets heated easily. You can not talk for a long time. You can not hear other persons voice clearly. Hearing other persons voice is a challenge and when we are out then you can bearly hear voice. Battery drains in 5 to 6 hours. Please dont buy this phone. Buy any other phone but not this for sure.
"
"Phone look is fine but proper handling is required if you are using it without back cover. Too scratchy. Battery performance is moderate. Amazon / Samsung should provide back plastic cover atleast as I waited for its availability in the market/site. Even now good covers are not available post 10 days of launch.
"
"The product is really awesome  and infinitely  o display is just wow and on screen sound technology  bhi they have given premium touch to the phone they should also add back cover in the box
"
"Great phone. Does what is promised. One UI is smooth and easy. Fingerprint scanner has gestures but some more would have been nice. Not a lot of gesture contols but overall great product.
"
"The phone looks good, and the performance wise average. It is light weight and easy to handle. Especially sound clarity with Dolby Atmos is just amazing, feels like sitting in theater. Camera is not much good, the clarity is poor.  Fast charging .. but, it draining as like fast charging. Bio metric finger lock is working fast as compared to face recognition lock. While calling sound on screen is good. Overall, look wise it is fabulous, camera is not much good, battery is poor. But, Music with Dolby Atmos is awesome.
"

"Honestly phone is very cute. With o infinity display Galaxy M40 is a master piece at that price also with snap dragon 675 soc. However a small pinch of pain pervades me due to hybrid slot which is not a Samsung design. I am missing SD card. Also I am missing s Amoled display. Small problem is with call receiving where voice is low and echoing. I hope samsung will fix those minor issues. Other wise phone touch is fantastic. Speed is good. No heating issues. Battery life is good for complete day usage. Overall I give 4 stars.

Drains very fast. I have to charge the phone two times in a day.-Value for money - Yes. But battery drain will annoy you.

"Awesome product.The Smartphone is very smooth and fast.Display is super.Performance of this M40 with snapdragon 675 processor is very smooth in comparison to exynos processor used by samsung phone.Camera quality is amazing.Phone speaker is loud and sufficient for watching videos.My criteria to buy this phone was performance and I'll give 5 out of 5.Don't bother about 3.5 mm jack and amoled screen, they are nothing in comparison of features of this phone.Go for this manufactured in India smartphone, you wont feel disappointed.

"Amazon is not even ready to take return and replace with any other phone.Cons:Main Drawback of M40 is its camera quality. Photos look like blurred.I had used J7 and on8 in past this phone has not pictures quality like them.Photos look like they are clicked from a low range mobile.On screen speaker is causing problem in audio quality.Memory is 128 GB but I can see 26 GB is already reserved.Earphone is C-type so it can not be used with other 3.5 MM jacks.Pros:Speed and battery life is good and satisfactory.6 GB Ram and 128 GB space is in this range is satisfactory.Phone does not heat up like other Samsung phone does while charging and using mobile data.

"Received a defective item. Speaker produing an unpleasant noise. Front camera is a complete disappointment. one can get a much better camera  quality from honor or other brands in the same price range. Rest everything looks good.  As there is no return option available for mobile phones one has to request for a replacement.  For this also Amazon takes so much of your time. Waiting for my replacement, hopefully it comes soon.

"Nice mobile
"
"Good performance, camera quality is ok but not the best. display and outer looks are awesome. One drawback is that few apps are closing when clicked on notifications. need to reinstall/update and test again. Overall I like this one.
"
"Totally unhappy with the battery life though it survives the entire day without much scare but heavy users need to stay away from this phone.The sound during calls is not at all clear and quite uncomfortable probably due to on-screen sound featureDoesn't have a notification led nor samsung pay.Also the 3.5mm headphone jack is missing and so is the connector.Many features missing for the priceM30 or a50 can be a better choice tahn this.
"
"On screen sound technology gives a feeling of echos & vibrations in entire screen while hearing. Not very comfortable. Think before buy if anyone feels that hearing voice is not important for him/her.
"
"Camera quality is fantastic,fingerprint  reader is also good,battery life  is not bad ,give you a whole day which depends on data usage.

"Very good
"

"
"So I've had this phone for about 5 days now, but I think that should be enough for me to review it.This is my first phone ever and so I was carefull in researching which one I should buy, and I settled for the Galaxy M40 (midnight blue).Screen Quality:Aside from the quality of the black colours I could not find any difference between the Amoled panel of the Galaxy M30. The colours look vibrant and lively and the brightness levels too are very good. No problem in viewing it in broad daylight. The difference in Black too is noticeable only when you have something to compare it with and you look at it in dark environment. So I have absolutely no complaints there. The Hole Punch display makes it look highly desirable too.Camera: The Camera modes are exceptionally diverse and you'll find every setting you could wish for. Hyperlapse, Slo Mo, Super Slo Mo, everything. The wide angle lens is the most useful feature of this setup for me. The colours look realistic if not poppy (which you can alter in the settings). Also you have to manually set the camera to it's highest resolution in the settings.  The details could have been better for a 32 MP Sensor, but they are very good nonetheless.Hardware: The hardware is arguably the best you could find under the 20000 INR range. The only phone that compares is POCO F1. The SD 675 Is highly competent at handling pretty much anything you throw at it and the RAM management is good too. It can play PUBG at (High, HD, Shadows enabled) with ease. The phone is light and a little slippery due to it's ""Glasstik"" back. The back looks very premium. Better buy a protective case with this.Battery: Now this is something about the phone that might be a dealbreaker. The battery fast charges to full in an Hour and 30 mins and is enough for regular use (Social Media, an hour of moderate gaming) even upto a day and probably more. But that's it. If you plan on doing intensive tasks without a plug nearby, you could be in trouble. The absence of a headphone jack adds to the problem with you not being able to charge while listening to music. So tread carefully.Overall,I'd easily recommend this phone to anyone in the market for the 20K segment. I could not have made a better choice (as of now). The phone ticks each box except for battery capacity. It's a Samsung( with a brand value that Xiaomi, Poco, Vivo and oppo cannot match) so I highly doubt you'll have any post purchase issues.Thank you, for reading the review.

"Samsung galaxy M40 supplied by  Amazon on 20 6.19.  The voice of incoming calls and outgoing calls voice sound is very very low.  This is not advisable to take because every low voice in calls and it very difficult in traffic. Battery charging also bad.  D.MANOHAR RAO  6300137387

"Finally I think Samsung got their mid segment phone combination right. Though you miss amoled display however punch hole display works just fine.  Working smooth with decent battery life. If it's within your budget go for it instead of cheap Chinese products.

"Worst Camera  it's just like 15 MPXL..Captured picture is just like apply a filter..And size or photos is below 4MB ..No background information showing in any photo clearly after very less zoom..I compared with 13mp camera and both 32MP  and 13Mp having almost same Quality.. if I increase Britness level in13MP camera .. ghatiya Camera he ek dam

That's all.Its screen does not get brighten when call is received.Callers number and name do not appear on the screen but they appear at 'Notification Bar'.On screen speaker vibrate a lot.The caller's voice quality is very poor and at times one cannot understand what the caller is saying.Before I could not down the PROS in the phone, its CONS disappointed me a lot and I decided to return the phone.Such poor quality product is not expected from the house of Samsung.

Even though the price is low, samsung has not compromised on the quality and performance of the smartphone.The camera is sharp and brilliant.The feel of the touchscreen is smooth.The RAM and Internal storage is a huge plus point.The fingerprint and face recognition is fast.

"Bought this mobile with some great expectations from Samsung and let’s see if it met them or not.Contents:🔹Handset🔹Quick charger🔹USB type C cable🔹Type C in ear earphones🔹Sim ejection tool🔹User manualInitial impressions:📌 The product is way better than other models and that's mainly due to the shiny poly carbonate back which attracts fingerprints but unexpectedly not slippery at all and gives a great option for one handed usage.📌 The lack of more Colour options rather than just blue might be an issue for some people but i love this colour.📌The mobile is light in weight and very thin as well improving its looks.Comes with Oreo out of the box with Samsung's latest one UI.📌Good to see so many customisation options.Skipping all the usual stuff here are some important information about the deviceDisplay🔹I was skeptical about the quality of the display quality especially due to the absence of sAmoled display but the difference isn't much as the display is sufficiently brighter and the viewing angles are great.🔹Overall the experience was good with the infinity O display and the very small bezels.Camera▪The triple camera setup seems to work well especially in day light conditions.▪The primary shooter produces some really good images.▪Its already great to have a wide-angle camera.▪There is a dedicated camera for the depth effect which produces clear cut background effect for portrait photography.▪Super slow motion is finally available in M series and its a feast a watch it.▪It is capable of recording the videos at 4k which was missing in earlier models.▪Front camera performance is also good and no serious issues observed.▪Pro mode for experienced shootersPerformance🔹Packing with Snapdragon 675 SoC performance isn't a problem at all with this mobile.🔹The RAM management is great and the apps will never load out of memory with day to day usage and even with some intense gaming.🔹The experience is very smooth and no lagging is observed.Battery🔸the battery lasts really long even with the 3500 mAh battery as the SD 675 SOC is power efficient.🔸the charger bundled is quick charging capable and charges the mobile in around 90-100 minutes.Gaming performance🔹I played Pubg and asphalt with all the settings put into high and the experience was good.🔹There is no lag observed while playing and even after switching between games.🔹the default settings came as high for Pubg and it ran very smoothly.🔹There is no heating issue observed except a slight warm at the back even after some intense gaming.Pros🔺📌Good design📌Camera performance📌Processor📌Screen sound technology📌Support for wide vine L1📌Good performance in terms of gaming📌NFC capability📌Dolby Atmos📌DDR 4 Ram (faster)Cons🔻📌Missing of the headphone jack...well this might be an issue for some people but hopefully they did it better by providing the type c earphones out of the box and being a user of all wireless audio systems, it won’t bother me though as it actually helps in making the mobile thin📌Camera bump as more chances to get damaged in case of damages.🔸Other than these two I didn't find any issues so far and since the two are not a deal breakers I can say that I had no issues with the mobile so far.🔹and finally with usage of around a week I can definitely feel it as one of the best mobiles sub 20000 categories as of now.🔹Will be updating the review if required.I hope am helpful 👍

"Hi in this phone the major drawback is the speaker quality.. the opposite party voice is not  clear, it will be broad and seems like they are speaking from inside the well. I opted for return  but Amazon declined as it is the feature of the phone and Amazon could not bear that.  HD voice call is good. But there other calls really so bad. Whatever may be the other features our prime job with phone is to talk right?.. For a normal usage battery is serving a day with the data alone in ON condition. Camera clarity is very average.  You can better go for A50 fort better performance at low cost.
"
"Display is good despite no amoled. Cameras are not upto mark. Pic quality pixel blurring while zooming.  Battery life is standard. Full day support without net once charged full.  Performance is very smooth. No complain. Headphone sound quality is also good

"I watched countless reviews before purchasing, and every one said that the battery backup is decent. It was decent too when I was using it out of the box, but after installing the day one update, the battery performance has become horrible. The rest is fine and dandy, but the battery performance disappoints.Edit: So after some days of use, it feels like the device is a scam. The 170k+ antutu scores that YouTubers were recieving were a sham, or maybe these ""reviewers"" were given some special units which were beating Redmi Note 7 Pro in antutu. This phone is supposed to have Snapdragon 675, and this is the performance I get? My Moto G5S plus performs better than this phone. Look at the attached camera sample, feels like taken from a cheap Chinese phone. Just too many cons in this device to list, only one pro is the Hole punch. Don't even think of gaming on this phone, PUBG and even light games like Asphalt Nitro are unplayable due to horrible lag. Better go with Note 7 Pro or Realme 3 pro. Thinking of getting a refund.

"Average phone
"
"I just brought it and the screen is amazing, just because of the camera the phone looks so good and the phone is all over very nice.. and the camera is fantastic but i got a defective one... just plz replace it fast ....
"
"Voice quality very poor, hear double sound , plus phone does look like Samsung product.
"
"Network connectivity is poor, Whatsapp video calling very poor, video stops. Normal calling also not good.
"
"Not worth the hard earned moneySoftware,  camera and performance do not add up to the specs.Update after 5 days of usage - In display speaker is a big issue. Phone vibrates while speaking; voice from the other side not clear at all.Biggest issue - The phone screen will not turn on to notify when some one calls. I will have to manually unlock the device, swipe down from notifications in order to see who is calling me. This is a big pain given that I travel a lot and cannot afford to unlock my phone just to see who is calling me. Batter life continues to be below par.
"
"All the features have written seems to be very good but they are definitely not. Camera quality is soo poor and very weird sound of speakers.
"
"The phone is the best that I've used till date. The fingerprint sensor is really quick and so is the face unlock. Camera being a great thing about it,the 32MP camera gives a very good view of the things,the ultrawide lens gives a view that is almost what the human eye is able to see. The SSD technology is another great feature of it. Five stars seem to be less for this marvelous piece.
"
"This product is very cool and impressive but the only issue with this product is its sound when u call someone it becomes very irritating and hectic because u r not able to hear properly that is a very major issue with this product
"
"Camera quality  is pretty  good.Worth of ruppes.

"Infinity O display is amazing.It is Widevine L1 certified, can watch Full HD Netflix and Prime.Battery is decent, works for a full day with moderate use. Can extend it to day and a half with minimal usage.Coming from a stock Android experience, One UI is decent and looks good.Fast Charging with this phone is good. Other reviews seem to exaggerate the heat while charging, it does heat up like any other devices with fast charging.Cons:No AMOLED, M30 at a similar price point has one.Battery could have been 4000 mAh

"Everything is bad about this phone. It's a compromised model. If you're reading this, go buy A50 which is THE BEST. Samsung is fooling around with its customers and so is Amazon. So please don't get deceived.
